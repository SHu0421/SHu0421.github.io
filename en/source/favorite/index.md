Here, I mainly show some of my hobbies apart from technology. I will consider creating separate pages to display them, but for now, let's just outline them and start the groundwork.


In my spare time, I enjoy reading, cooking, learning new languages, and exercising.

Regarding reading, I like to explore articles of different genres, including novels, essays, and travelogues. I mainly keep my reading notes on OneNote and hope to have the opportunity to update them here in the future.

When it comes to cooking, I enjoy making home-cooked meals and baking (PS: I enjoy cooking but not washing dishes). I find it magical to transform different ingredients into delicious dishes. After graduating, I have tried some simple stir-fries and soups. I hope to become more proficient and master a wider range of recipes in the future. As for baking, I like baking cakes and bread (without cream and with less sugar). However, I am currently at the theoretical knowledge stage, and I hope to have the chance to put it into practice.

In terms of languages, I hope to actively utilize this language tool rather than passing the exams by reading English magazines and listening to English podcasts. Recently, I have started to learn Japanese. Japanese writing and pronunciation are similar to Chinese. Besides, I enjoy watching Japanese anime. Therefore, I chose it as my third language. In the future, I hope to master more language and use it as a bridge to access a rich variety of resources in the world.

Life is about movement. We need not only nourishment for our minds and souls but also a healthy and strong body. In respect of exercise, I prefer simple activities like running and feather yoga. I hope to insist these habits however busy in the future. Besides, I am intersted in other sports such as table tennis and swimming.

"When you realize that life is only once, you gain a second life." In addition to persistently learning professional knowledge and technology, I hope to explore more interests in the future. I will always love life and embrace it!

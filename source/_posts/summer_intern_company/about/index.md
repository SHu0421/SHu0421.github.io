Hello, my name is Shuang Hu. I have graduated from Zhejiang University as a postgraduate in March, 2023. Now, I am working at my hometown Chongqing.

I have two-year research experience in the fields of Deep Learning and Software Development. I have worked on several projects in these areas (details in CV), and have gained valuable skills and knowledge along the way.

I am a passionate learner and always eager to expand my knowledge and skills. Besides, I also love to take on new challenges. I believe that every challenge presents an opportunity for growth and development, and I am always ready to step up and take on new tasks and responsibilities.

Finally, I take pride in my work and am fully responsible for every task that I undertake. I expect to have a chance to work with you!
